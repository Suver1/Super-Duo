# Super-Duo
Super Duo! is the third project in the Android developer Nanodegree @ Udacity.

The goal is to improve two pre-existing apps; one book list and barcode scanner app called Alexandria, and one app that tracks current and future football matches, called Football Scores.

The Nanodegree is co-created by Google and can be found here: https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree--nd801
